// Package handlers provides HTTP endpoint handlers for the game server.
// It contains handler functions for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
// Each handler is responsible for a specific domain, such as player management,
// inventory management, or the combat system.
// This modular design improves code organization and maintainability
// as the game server grows in complexity.
